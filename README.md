*** NeatLatex
Neatly compiles PDF of a given latex project (the main document) and then moves the resulting PDF file to ./output and the rest of the intermediate files to ./auxlog

*** Options
`-c` : Cleans up the working project directory from all the intermediate aux and log files.
`-b <bib_file>` : Cleans up the references (the .bib file) from "abstrac", "files", "keywords", etc. fields autogenerated by Mendeleys reference management.
`-v` : Verbosity.

*** Installation
Copy the version you want to use as neatlatex to your /usr/bin/ as below:
`sudo cp neatlatex3.py /usr/bin/neatlatex`

*** Usage
** To compile a PDF for a latex project with the main document named as "main.tex":
`neatlatex main`
** To clean up the reference file named as "refs.bib" auto-generated by Mendeley:
`neatlatex main -b refs.bib`
** To clean up the intermediate aux and log files from the working project directory without compiling the project:
`neatlatex main -c`
